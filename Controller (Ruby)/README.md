# Controller : ServiceLayer::DataController #

#### File Description ####

This controller is one piece of a number of files making up a service layer for the server side of a trucking company management system called DriverBuddy. This controller acts as a RESTful API resource for a mobile application communicating back and forth with the main RoR application. The mobile app is for shipping and trucking, so the methods relate to getting available vehicles, or shipments for the logged in user, and moving through the various steps of a shipment process.

This file would continue to grow (and probably be split into a few separate files) as the project advances through subsequent sprints. Over time, it would be fleshed out to support additional functionality for the mobile app for more advanced account types that have extra permissions and additional features.
