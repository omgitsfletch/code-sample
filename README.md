# Overview #

Included in this repository are a number of small code samples intended to demonstrate my proficiency working with various aspects of a typical Ruby on Rails MVC application. Most of the included work relates to work I did at TrueNorth Technology from April thru December, 2013.

In each sub-folder, I've included Markdown-formatted READMEs explaining further each work, with necessary background information and additional details. Where possible, I have referenced the original code commits or actual code repositories, and have included links to outside websites in cases where my work is still in actual use by said clients.

In the case of the [DriverBuddy](http://home.driverbuddy.com) application, I was responsible for roughly 75-80% of the original development work on both the mobile application, and the backend management system. If there is any uncertainty on whether I responsible for something showcased on DriverBuddy's website or demo videos, please feel free to contact me directly via email for more information.
